## Overview

Here's the plan of how we are planning to spend the session.

### Discussion (30 min)

Discussion of minimal computing, what people think it is, challenges/provocations from the readings. This is just to get us started we'll have time to dig into some of the details later.

### Experimentation (1 hr)

We'll start with a very brief introduction to distributed web projects, and what the BeakerBrowser project is.

Please install [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/) and see if you can make heads or tails of the [tour](dat://beakerbrowser.com/docs/tour)

Here are some (possibly) interesting sites to look at in Beaker (thanks to [\@sifr](https://anticapitalist.party/@sifr/100796107622467085) for some of these)

* [p2p forever .org](http://p2pforever.org/)

Try to create a new project, and a file called `index.md` within it. Add some
text to it.  Read about the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax which is a relatively easy way to write HTML that is focused on text rather than angle brackets.  Check out this [cheatsheet](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf), which we'll have some copies of on hand.

See if you can share your site with others by emailing them the *Dat URL*. If they aren't able to see it email it to Ed at [ehs@pobox.com](mailto:ehs@pobox.com) so he can try seeding it from outside the UMD network.

Try to "seed" a site. What do you think this means? Why would you want to seed a site? Can you figure out where the data is stored locally on your computer?

Disconnect from the Internet and see what you are still able to browse and read.

If you are really getting into this, try installing [Dat], which is the underlying protocol and software library that Beaker uses. See if you can figure out how to use it to fetch the site you created. Or this site: dat://mincomp.mith.us

### Discussion (1 hr)

We have some time to talk about what we learned about Beaker, and how it may or may not relate to minimal computing and the goals of resistance. Here are some possible discussion topics:

What, if any, is the relationship between minimal computing and resistance? How do you "resist" social media or digital culture more generally? Are there points of friction or "resistance" that feel like barriers to you?

Based on what we know about minimal computing and our recent experience using Beaker, do you consider Beaker to be an example of a minimal computing project? In what ways does it support the goals of minimal computing, and in what ways doesn't it?

Did you notice how Beaker is able to look at the normal HTTP web? It also uses DNS. How does Beaker work to remediate the web?

What questions came to mind as you were experimenting with Beaker? How is it the same and different from the usual web? Can you imagine examples of places where Beaker could be useful, or examples of where it could actually prove problematic? What are the impacts on ethics and privacy that a distributed web application like Beaker entails?

How does minimal computing engage questions of infrastructure, equitability, resilience, collaboration?

What can initiatives like Nimble Tents offer you, for your scholarship, for your activism? Building on Gil's question of "what do we need"?

How does specific work in minimal computing play into the role of digital technology in the environment?

What does minimal computing have to contribute to discussions of "decolonizing" the Internet? Are there theoretical frames here that we could use to inform our mincomp practice?

Is mincomp a method for maintainers? If so, in what ways? Do ideas of maintenance change our practice?

How does minimal computing help us think/critique/engage with the tools of our scholarship, impacts on environments, communities, architectures of social media, reliance on corporate platforms (surveillance vs. ease of communication) and alternative platforms.
