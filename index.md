## Overview

Here's the plan of how we are planning to spend the time.

### Discussion (30 min)

Discussion of minimal computing, what people think it is, challenges/provocations from the readings (30 min)

### Experimentation (1 hr)

Brief introduction to [distributed web]() projects, and the BeakerBrowser project.

Install [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/) and see if you can figure out what to navigate to. Try the [tour](dat://beakerbrowser.com/docs/tour)

Here are some interesting things to look at:

* some fun zine links here...

Try to create a new project, and a file called `index.md`. Add some text to it. Read about the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax which is a relatively easy way to write HTML, focused on text rather than angle brackets. Check out this [cheatsheet](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf).

See if you can share your site with others by emailing them the *Dat URL*. If they aren't able to see it email it to Ed at [ehs@pobox.com](mailto:ehs@pobox.com) so he can try it.

### Discussion (1 hr)

Based on what we know about minimal computing and our recent experience using Beaker, do you have thoughts about whether Beaker is an example of a minimal computing project. In what ways does it support the goals of minimal computing, and in what ways doesn't it.

What questions came to mind as you were experimenting with Beaker? How is it the same and different from the usual web? Can you imagine examples of places where Beaker could be useful, or examples of where it could actually prove problematic? What are the impacts on ethics and privacy that a distributed web application like Beaker entails?
